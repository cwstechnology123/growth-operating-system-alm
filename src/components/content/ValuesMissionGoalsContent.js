                <p><b>Values Statements</b> articulate an organization’s core beliefs and principles that drive performance and behavior. A foundational component of a healthy organization is an articulated set of values that are shared by its members and guide its core beliefs, actions and culture. Being intentional about how those values influence the way employees interact with one another, make decisions, and celebrate accomplishments helps to build a culture rooted in shared values, which fosters alignment across teams and the entire organization.</p>

                    <p style={{padding: 10}}>A Mission Statement defines the fundamental purpose for why a company exists and may include aspects of the organization’s scope and values. A Mission Statement is arguably the most critical tool an organization can have to communicate to employees, customers, shareholders, and the world at large, in a succinct sentence or two, what it is trying to create or achieve on a daily basis. It represents the organization’s core beliefs about itself and its desired impact. It is different from a vision statement, which defines and describes what the organization wishes to be in the future</p>

They articulate what the organization plans to do to fulfill its mission and vision, and they form the foundation for designing and implementing strategic initiatives, which are the actual projects and programs that get implemented in service of accomplishing the Strategic Goals.</p>
                    <p style={{padding: '0 10px'}}>Strategic Goals represent the desired conditions the organization has identified for itself that are critical for its future success and are most often articulated at the culmination of a strategic planning process. Based upon a comprehensive analysis of its strengths, opportunities, weaknesses, threats and environmental factors, executive leaders must derive accurate implications and logically deduce what an organization needs to do to move forward strategically to compete effectively in its markets, and then articulate that in a succinct and compelling manner. The Strategic Goals look both upward and downward, in that they communicate the future direction of the organization, tied to the overall vision, but also set the stage for designing the initiatives, operational activities and key performance indicators (KPIs) that are all set into motion based on accomplishing the Strategic Goals.</p>
